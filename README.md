CMake Example
=============

Introduction
------------

[CMake](https://cmake.org/) is an open-source software for building software projects in a platform-independent way.

This repository consists of an example whose motivation is outlined [here](http://www.rwanwork.info/sysdocs/cmake/overview/).  Please consult this web site for more information since it goes together with this repository.

In fact, the files in this repository were previously hosted as a tar.gz archive on my homepage.  Comments on the CMake mailing list have shown me that I still have a lot to learn and keeping this on GitHub is perhaps more convenient.


About CMake Example
-------------------

This software was implemented by Raymond Wan while I was at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.  My contact details are:

     E-mails:  rwan.work@gmail.com 
               OR 
               raymondwan@ust.hk

My homepage is [here](http://www.rwanwork.info/).

The latest version of this CMake Example can be downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/rwanwork/CMake-Example).

If you have any information about bugs, suggestions for the documentation or just have some general comments, feel free to write to the above address.


History
-------

Some users who clearly know more about CMake than I do have offered some comments to what I've done.  While I have not accepted all of their comments (since the aim of this example is slightly [different](http://www.rwanwork.info/sysdocs/cmake/summary-1/)), they are of course more right than wrong.

Thank you for the advice!

About This Repository
---------------------

This GitHub repository was created from the original tarball on my homepage (which I placed in November 2015, along with several HTML pages to walk users through it).  Placing it in GitHub will hopefully allow me to update it as necessary.
